        <para n="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am
            actually off to <loc>France</loc> and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone.
            Everything has happened so quickly since the <comp>American Fund for French
                Wounded</comp> found an opening for me in <loc>Paris</loc> that I suppose I am still
            somewhat dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and
            that I can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I
            have had a bit of a taste in <loc>New York</loc> of the work that the <comp>A. F. F.
                W.</comp> is doing but its <loc>Headquarters</loc> in <loc>Paris</loc> will be different in
            some ways I fancy.</para>

        <para n="2">I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how <desc>few
                girls of my age</desc> are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which
            made you encourage me on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so
            dangerous of late.</para>

        <para n="3">As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
            alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our
            minds. How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet,
            no one spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after
            another appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in
                <loc>Lakewood</loc> and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my
            heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</para>

        <para n="4">We waited near the <loc>Statue of Liberty</loc> until midnight—a rumor had it
            that a "personage" was to come on board. <desc>This individual was shrouded in
                mystery</desc> until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had
            clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose
            at once for, what with <name>Frank Sayre</name> on the boat and these
                <desc>distinguished Italian gentlemen</desc>, we shall doubtless be honored by a
            bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers following
            us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and seem
            to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. A sailor informed
            me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or five days but that
            after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!</para>

        <para n="5">I have a <loc>small inside cabin</loc> and my room-mate is <desc>quite a
                character</desc>. She is a <desc>native of <loc>Haiti</loc>, voluble and very
                portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a costume which
                resembles a <name>Mother Hubbard</name> and smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like
                incense!</desc> When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as
            she says, luckily <desc>I am small</desc>, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth
            with my belongings! She really isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me
            that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed upon me! She is going
            over to join her son who has been fighting with the French since the beginning of the
            war but will never go back to the <loc>Front</loc> now, having lost some fingers off each hand. She
            is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.</para>
